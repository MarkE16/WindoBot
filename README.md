# Bot Features
So far it only has little commands such as utility commands and small "fun" commands. However, the bot is still in production so there will be more features in the future.

The bot is currently in alpha v1.1.1. So I'm still working on the bot but allowing people to use it as I develop it. You can view the changelog [here](https://github.com/MarkE16/WindoBot#changelog).
