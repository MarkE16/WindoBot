# Windo Discord Bot
### ( Official Name still in the works )

Hello! This is the github page for my Discord bot! In the future (hopefully), I will be able to make this bot public for people to use.

# Bot Features
So far it only has little commands such as utility commands and small "fun" commands. However, the bot is still in production so there will be more features in the future.

# Bot Version
The bot is currently in BETA 0.2. So I'm still working on the bot but allowing people to use it as I develop it.

# Link to Bot
Currently, I'm not releasing the bot to the public yet. Only friends and people I trust can have access to the bot, so the link is unavailable at this time.
